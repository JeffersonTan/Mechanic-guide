				<h1>Introduction</h1>

				<div class=dual-circuit>
					<h2>Dual-circuit braking system</h2>
					<img src=dual-circuit.png width="100%" height="auto">
					<p>A typical dual-circuit braking system. Each of the circuits controls both the front and rear wheels. By pressing the brake pedal, fluids from the master cylinder are forced out along the brake pipes to the slace cylinders at the wheels.</p>
				</div>

					<p>
					You can find brakes on almost any modern vehicles, which are usually powered by a hydraulic system. The brakes may be disc type or drum type.<br><br>

					Since during braking most of the weight of a car is shifted towards the front, the front brakes are more important than the rear brakes. Therefore, many cars have disc brakes at the front which are generally more efficient and drum brakes at the rear.
					<br><br>
					All disc braking systems are mostly used on high-end cars like luxury or performance oriented cars, while all-drum systems are used on some older or smaller cars. It's because brake discs are generally more complex and expensive to engineer than drums.

				<h2>Brake Hydraulics</h2>
				
				<div class=master-slave>

					<p>When the pedal is pressed, the master cylinder sends hydraulic pressure to the slave cylinders.</p>

				<p>
				Nowadays, almost all cars uses hyraulic brake system. What exactly is that?<br>
				Hydraulic brake system is a system that uses a fluid-filled master and slave cylinders that are connected by pipes.<br><br>
				</p>
				
				<p>
				When the brake pedal is pressed, a piston in the master cylinder is pressed. Forcing fluid along the brake lines/pipes.
				Then, the slave cylinders at each wheels gets filled with brake fluid thus forcing pistons out to apply to the brakes.<br><br>

				Fluid pressure will distribute itself evenly around the system.<br><br>
			
				The combined surface 'pushing' area of all the slave pistons is much larger than that of the piston in the master cylinder.
				Consequently, the master piston has to travel several inches to move the slave pistons the fraction of an inch it takes to apply the brakes.<br><br>

				This setup allows huge force to be exerted by the brakes, in the same way that a long-handled lever can easily lift a heavy object a short distance.<br><br>

				Modern cars nowadays are fitted with twin hydraulic circuits, with two master cylinders in tandem in case one of them fails. Sometimes one of the circuits acts on the front brakes and the other on the rear brakes; Or one acts on all four wheels and the other only acts on the front wheels.<br><br>

				Under heavy braking, a lot of the car's mass are shifted towards the front. Possibly lifting the rear wheels and causing them to lock, which will then cause the car to skid. Because of this, the rear brakes are made less powerful than the front brakes.
				<br><br>

				Most cars now also have a load-sensitive pressure-limiting valve. It closes during heavy braking when the fluid raises to a level that might cause the rear brakes to lock, thus preventing any further fluid movement.
