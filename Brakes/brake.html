				<h1>Introduction</h1>

				<div class=floating>
					<h2>Dual-circuit braking system</h2>
					<img src=dual-circuit.png width="100%" height="auto">
					<p>A typical dual-circuit braking system. Each of the circuits controls both the front and rear wheels. By pressing the brake pedal, fluids from the master cylinder are forced out along the brake pipes to the slace cylinders at the wheels.</p>
				</div>

					<p>
						You can find brakes on almost any modern vehicles, which are usually powered by a hydraulic system. The brakes may be disc type or drum type.<br><br>

						Since during braking most of the weight of a car is shifted towards the front, the front brakes are more important than the rear brakes. Therefore, many cars have disc brakes at the front which are generally more efficient and drum brakes at the rear.
						<br><br>
						All disc braking systems are mostly used on high-end cars like luxury or performance oriented cars, while all-drum systems are used on some older or smaller cars. It's because brake discs are generally more complex and expensive to engineer than drums.

				<h2>Brake Hydraulics</h2>
				
				<div class=floating>
					<img src=master-slave.png width="100%" height="auto">
					<p>When the pedal is pressed, the master cylinder sends hydraulic pressure to the slave cylinders.</p>
				</div>

				<p>
				Nowadays, almost all cars uses hyraulic brake system. What exactly is that?<br>
				Hydraulic brake system is a system that uses a fluid-filled master and slave cylinders that are connected by pipes.<br><br>
				</p>
				
				<p>
					When the brake pedal is pressed, a piston in the master cylinder is pressed. Forcing fluid along the brake lines/pipes.
					Then, the slave cylinders at each wheels gets filled with brake fluid thus forcing pistons out to apply to the brakes.<br><br>

					Fluid pressure will distribute itself evenly around the system.<br><br>
				
					The combined surface 'pushing' area of all the slave pistons is much larger than that of the piston in the master cylinder.
					Consequently, the master piston has to travel several inches to move the slave pistons the fraction of an inch it takes to apply the brakes.<br><br>

					This setup allows huge force to be exerted by the brakes, in the same way that a long-handled lever can easily lift a heavy object a short distance.<br><br>

					Modern cars nowadays are fitted with twin hydraulic circuits, with two master cylinders in tandem in case one of them fails. Sometimes one of the circuits acts on the front brakes and the other on the rear brakes; Or one acts on all four wheels and the other only acts on the front wheels.<br><br>

					Under heavy braking, a lot of the car's mass are shifted towards the front. Possibly lifting the rear wheels and causing them to lock, which will then cause the car to skid. Because of this, the rear brakes are made less powerful than the front brakes.
					<br><br>

					Most cars now also have a load-sensitive pressure-limiting valve. It closes during heavy braking when the fluid raises to a level that might cause the rear brakes to lock, thus preventing any further fluid movement.

				<h2>Power-assisted Brakes</h2>
				
				<div class=floating style="float:left;margin-left:2%;">
					<img src=servo-assist.png width="100%" height="auto">
					<p>A direct-acting servo is installed between the brake pedal and the master cylinder. The pedal can directly push the master cylinder if the servo fails or if the engine isn't running.</p>
				</div>

				<p>
					A lot of cars also comes with brake servos to reduce the effort needed to apply the brakes.<br>
					<br>
					Usually the source of power comes from the difference in pressure between the partial vacuum in the inlet manifold and outside air. The servo unit which assists braking has a pipe leading to the inlet manifold.<br>
					<br>
					A direct-acting servo is installed between the brake pedal and the master cylinder. The pedal pushes a rod that in turn pushes the master-cylinder piston. The brake pedal also works on a set of air valves, and there's a large rubber diaphragm connected to the master-cylinder piston. When the brakes are off, both sides of the diaphragm are exposed to the vacuum from the manifold.<br>
					<br>
					Pressing the brake pedal closes the valve linking the rear side of the diaphragm to the manifold, opening a valve that lets air in from the outside. The higher pressure of the outside air will force the diaphragm forward to push on the master-cylinder piston, which will then add to the braking force. If the pedal is then held, and pressed no further, the air valve won't draw extra air from outside, so the pressure on the brakes remains the same.<br>
					<br>
					When the pedal is released, the space behind the diaphragm is reopened to the manifold, so the pressure drops and the diaphragm falls back. If the vacuum fails because the engine has stopped, for example, the brakes will still work because there is a normal mechanical link between the pedal and the master cylinder. But much more force must be exerted on the brake pedal to apply them.<br>
					<br>
					Some cars have an indirect-acting servo fitted in the hydraulic lines between the master cylinder and the brakes. This type of servo can be mounted anywhere in the engine compartment instead of having to be directly in front of the pedal.<br>
					<br>
					The indirect-acting servo also relies on manifold vacuum to provide the boost. Pressing the brake pedal causes hydraulic pressure build up from the master cylinder, a valve then opens and triggers the vacuum servo.<br>

				<h2>Disc brake</h2>

				<div class=floating>
					<img src=brake-pads.png width="100%" height="auto">
					<p>A simple disc brake, with a single pair of pistons. It's possible to have more than one pairs or a single piston operating on both pads, like a scissor.</p>
				</div>

				<p>
					A disc brake has a disc that turns with the wheel. The disc is straddled by a caliper , in which there are small hydraulic pistons controlled by pressure from the master cylinder.<br><br>
					
					The pistons press on friction pads that clamps against the disc from each side to slow or stop it. The pads are shaped to cover a broad sector of the disc.<br><br>
					
					There may be more than a single pair of pistons, especially in dual-circuit brakes.<br><br>

					The pistons only moves by a tiny distance to apply the brakes, and the pads barely clear the discs when the brakes are released. They have no return springs.<br><br>

					When the brake is applied, fluid pressure forces the pads against the disc. With the brake off, both pads barely clear the discs. Rubber sealing rings around the pistons are designed to let the pistons slip forward gradually as the pads wear down, so that the tiny gap remains constant and the brakes do not need adjustment.<br><br>

					Many newer cars have wear sensors leads embedded in the pads. When the pads are nearly worn out, the leads are exposed and short-circuited by the metal disc, illuminating a warning light on the instrument panel.<br><br>

				<h2>Drum Brake</h2>

				<div class=floating style="float:left;margin-left:2%;">
					<img src=drum-brake.png width="90%" height="auto">
					<p>A drum brake with leading and trailing shoe. This drum only has one hydraulic cylinder; Brakes with two leading shoes have a cylinder for each shoe and are fitted at the front wheels on an all-drum system.</p>
				</div>

				<p>
					A drum brake has a hollow drum that turns with the wheel. Its open back is covered by a stationary backplate on which there are two curved shoes carrying friction linings. The shoes are forced outwards by hydraulic pressure moving the pistons in the brake's wheel cylinders, pressing the linings against the inside of the drum to slow or stop it.<br><br>

					When the brakes are on, the shoes are forced against the drums by their piston. Each brake shoe has a pivot at one end and a piston at the other. A leading shoe has the piston at the leading edge relative to the direction in which the drum turns.<br><br>

					The rotation of the drum tends to pull the leading shoe firmly against it when it's making contact, improving the braking effect.<br><br>

					Some drums have twin leading shoes, each with its own hydraulic cylinder; others have one leading and one trailing shoe - with the pivot at the front.	This design allows the two shoes to be forced apart from each other by a single cylinder with a piston in each end. It's simpler but less powerful than the two-leading-shoe system, and is usually restricted to rear brakes.<br><br>

					In either type, return springs slightly pulls the shoes back when the brakes are released. Shoe travel is kept as short as possible by an adjuster. Older systems have manual adjusters that need to be turned from time to time as the friction linings wear. Later brakes have automatic adjustment by using a ratchet.<br><br></p>

						<img src=drum-mechanism.gif width="100%" height="auto">
						<p>A drum brake with leading and trailing shoe. This drum only has one hydraulic cylinder; Brakes with two leading shoes have a cylinder for each shoe and are fitted at the front wheels on an all-drum system.</p>
					</div>

				<p>
					Drum brakes may fade if they are applied repeatedly within a short time because they heat up quickly and lose their efficiency until they cool down again. Discs, with their more open construction, are much less prone to fading.<br><br>
