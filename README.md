# Mechanic's Guide
A web guide for new mechanics

This is originally coded for a school project, so the website looks rough.
You can view the webpage [via repl.it](https://mechanic-guide--jeffersontan.repl.co/index.html)(latest, unstable) or [via GitHub](https://jeffersontan.github.io/Mechanic-guide/)(More stable), please report any broken layouts or dead links
