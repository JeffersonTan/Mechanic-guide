								<b>Leaf spring</b> and <b>MacPherson Struts</b>, which is a typical suspension setup on a <b>RWD</b> car.
							</p>
						</div>
						<p>
							You can use different ways to attach the wheels to the car so they can move up and down on their springs and dampers and do so with minimal change in the distance between adjacent wheels or in the near-vetical angle of the tyres to the road. The front wheels must be able to freely turn on their steering swivels. The driven wheels, whether the front, rear, or both, must be able to freely spin with the drive shafts as well.
						</p>

						<h2>Non-independent Suspension</h2>
						<p>
							A <b>RWD</b> (Rear-Wheel-Drive) car often uses a live axle, a tube containing both the <b>driveshafts</b> (half shafts) and the differential gears. A <b>4WD</b> (Four-Wheel-Drive) may also have a live front axle as well. A dead axle (also called rigid beam), is now only used at the front on vans and trucks. Some <b>FWD</b> (Front-Wheel-Drive) cars have a dead axle. A rigid axle will have springs and links to prevent sideways movement.
						</p>

						<h2>Independent Suspension</h2>
						<p>
							In an independent suspension setup, each wheel on a car is independently attached to the body or the subframe. When driven wheels are independently suspended, the wheels are driven by jointed driveshafts that are connected to a differential that's fixed to the frame.
						</p>

						<p>There's five types of suspension setups that are commonly used.</p>

						<p>
							<b>Double wishbones</b>, which are commonly used at the front. There's two wishbones, one is above the other, to keep the wheel vertical as it go up and down.<br><br>

							<b>MacPherson-strut suspension</b>, which can be used at both the front or the rear. The wheel hub is fixed to a strut which has it's top end anchored to the frame or a reinforced fender. On the front wheels, the struts are able to rotate to allow steering. Pivoted arms extend inwards and forwards to the frame in order to keep the wheel vertical and to resist accelerating/decelerating forces.<br><br>
							
							A <b>trailing arm</b> is attached to the wheel hub on one end and extends forwards to a pivot on the frame. The arm may be broadened into a V shape with two pivots, either side-by-side or with the inner pivot slightly behind the front one. This setup is called a <b>semi-trailing arm</b> setup. Trailing arms are usually found only at the rear.<br><br>
