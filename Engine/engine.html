							An engine or a motor is a type of machine that's made to convert one form of energy into mechanical energy. Interal combustion engines (which is a type of heat engine) burns fuel to create heat which is then used to turn the wheels.<br><br>

							Why is it called an internal combustion engine? It's because mixtures of air and petrol that enters the engine's cylinder gets ignited by a spark-plug which causes it to burn rapidly, therefore making the air inside expand pushing the pistons down and creating power.<br><br>

							To withstand its heavy workload, the engine needs a robust structure. It's made out of two basic parts: the lower, heavier section which is the cylinder block, a casing for the engine's main moving parts; then the detachable upper cover which is the cylinder head.<br><br>

							The cylinder head contains valve-controlled passages where the air-fuel mixture enters the cylinder from and another passage where the exhaust gasses exits the cylinder<br><br>

							The block houses the crankshaft, which converts the reciprocating motion of the pistons into rotary motion at the crankshaft. Often the block also houses the camshaft , which operates mechanisms that open and close the valves in the cylinder head. Sometimes the camshaft is in the head or mounted above it.<br><br>
