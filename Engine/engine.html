						An engine or a motor is a type of machine that's made to convert one form of energy into mechanical energy. Interal combustion engines (which is a type of heat engine) burns fuel to create heat which is then used to turn the wheels.<br><br>

						Why is it called an internal combustion engine? It's because mixtures of air and petrol that enters the engine's cylinder gets ignited by a spark-plug which causes it to burn rapidly, therefore making the air inside expand pushing the pistons down and creating power.<br><br>

						To withstand its heavy workload, the engine needs a robust structure. It's made out of two basic parts: the lower, heavier section which is the cylinder block, a casing for the engine's main moving parts; then the detachable upper cover which is the cylinder head.<br><br>

						The cylinder head contains valve-controlled passages where the air-fuel mixture enters the cylinder from and another passage where the exhaust gasses exits the cylinder<br><br>

						The block houses the crankshaft, which converts the reciprocating motion of the pistons into rotary motion at the crankshaft. Often the block also houses the camshaft , which operates mechanisms that open and close the valves in the cylinder head. Sometimes the camshaft is in the head or mounted above it.<br><br>

					<p>
						The most simple and common type of engine uses 4 vertical cylinders close together in a row. This is known as an <b>in-line engine</b> or <b>straight engine</b>.

					</div>

					<p>
						Some cars uses the more compact <b>V-engine</b> (also called the 'Vee' engine), especially those that have 8 cylinders or more. It's called a V-engine because the cylinders are arranged opposite to each other at angle (usually no more than 90 degrees).

						<p><b>Flat</b> - 289 block</p>
					</div>

					<p>
						Some other engines have horizontally-opposed cylinders, which are usually called <b>flat engines</b>. They're V8 engines with 180 degrees of cylinder bank. It's advantages are less height since the cylinders are flat and it's more balanced in certain aspects.

						The cylinders and the mountings of an engine for things such as the oil filter and fuel pump are cast into the block. An oil reservoir, called the sump (or more commonly referred to as oil pan) is bolted underneath the crankcase.
