						<h1>Carburettors</h1>
						
						<div class=container1>
							<div class=floating>
								<img src=solex.gif width=100% height=auto>
								<p>A typical fixed-jet carburettor. This is a Solex type carburettor where the air flows from the top to bottom. This is called a down-draught carburettor.</p>
							</div>
						</div>

						<p>A carburettor mixes fuel and air to a certain ratio that the engine needs at any time. It does this by spraying fuel into the moving air stream through a jet, which vaporizes the fuel making an explosive mixture. The faster an engine runs, the more air it sucks in. The air passes through a narrow neck inside the carburettor (Called <b>venturi</b>), which speeds up its flow.</p>

						<p>As air flows faster, it's pressure drops which creates a small vacuum in the venturi. The fuel jet opens in the venturi, and the partial vacuum sucks fuel through the jet into the air stream. The speed of an engine is controlled by a throttle, a moveable circular flap linked to the gas pedal which partly blocks the venturi to control variable amounts of air.</p>

						<p>The simplest way to control the amount of fuel that flows through the jet so that the air-fuel ratio is correct is with a variable jet.
					</div>

					<div class=section>
						<h2>Variable Jet Carburettors</h2>

						<p>The fuel jet is partially blocked by a tapered needle, which can be raised progressively to unblock it. The needle is fixed to a piston, which is able to freely slide up and down in a chamber above the jet. The top of the chamber is linked to the intake manifold through a narrow passage.</p>
						
						<div class=container>
							<div class=floating>
								<img src=variable.png width=100% height=auto>
								<p>Low vacuum in the piston chamber.</p>
							</div>
							<div class=floating>
								<img src=variable2.png width=100% height=auto>
								<p>At full throttle, the butterfly valve is fully open.</p>
							</div>
							<div class=floating>
								<img src=variable3.png width=100% height=auto>
								<p>Operating the choke lowers the jet, which allows more fuel to be drawn in.</p>
							</div>
						</div>

						<p>When the engine idles, low manifold depression and light spring causes the piston to sit at the bottom of the chamber, and the needle almost completely blocks the jet. Only a small amount of fuel flows. As the throttle opens, more air flows into the engine. The engine speeds up and sucks more air in.</p>

						<p>This suction creates a partial vacuum in the intake manifold and in the top of the chamber. The vacuum is more powerful than the small vacuum in the venturi under the piston, so it pulls the piston up which unblocks the jet and lets more fuel flow. The sudden burst of acceleration will cause a sudden rush of mixture into the intake manifold, which weakens the vacuum.</p>

						<p>That allows the piston to fall, closing the jet and weakening the mixture. But, that can be solved by using an oil-filled damper attached to the piston, which prevents it from moving too quickly. Therefore, the mixture doesn't suddenly become too weak for a smooth combustion.</p>

						<h3>The float chamber</h3>

						<p>For a carburettor to maintain a steady fuel flow, it needs to draw from a fuel supply which is always kept at the same level. That supply is provided by a float chamber attached to the carburettor. The float chamber has a pivoted float which bears against a needle valve through which fuel enters the chamber.</p>
					</div>

					<div class=section>
						<h2>Fixed Jet Carburettors</h2>

						<p>The fixed jet Carburettors resembles the simpler <b>variable-jet</b> type in having a venturi. The partial vacuum caused by increased air speed through the venturi sucks fuel through a jet to mix with the air. Similarly, air flow is controlled by a throttle flap linked to the accelerator pedal to regulate engine speed. A choke flap above the throttle partially blocks the air flow to give a richer mixture for starting. Like in all carburettors, a float chamber provides a steady supply of fuel.</p>

						<h3>Changing from jet to jet</h3>

						<div class=container>
							<div class=floating>
								<img src=idle.png width=100% height=auto>
								<p>The engine idling with the throttle closed. A small amount of mixture passes through the caps on each side of the throttle flap, or butterfly.</p>
							</div>
							<div class=floating>
								<img src=sudden.png width=100% height=auto>
								<p>During sudden acceleration the accelerator pump comes into action and provides a richer mixture.</p>
							</div>
							<div class=floating>
								<img src=full.png width=100% height=auto>
								<p>The engine running fast at wide throttle. The butterfly is almost vertical, allowing free passage of the mixture.</p>
							</div>
						</div>

						<p>The fixed-jet carburettor has open <b>jets</b> to regulate fuel flow through them. Consequently there must be several jets of different sizes to provide the different amounts of fuel needed at any moment. When the engine is idling, very little fuel is required. There's not a lot of air flowing through the almost closed <b>throttle</b> - too little to draw any fuel through the main jet in the <b>venturi</b>.</p>

						<p>But there's a high <b>vacuum</b> underneath the throttle flap, where there's a tiny slow-running jet that forms part of the often complex slow-running (idling) circuit. The vacuum pulls a trickle of fuel through this jet to keep the engine idling.</p>

						<p>When the throttle is opened, the air flow suddenly speeds up. An <b>accelerator</b> pump linked to the throttle provides a brief squirt of extra fuel to enrich the mixture temporarily to prevent a flat spot - a momentary hesitation - which is the inability of the carburettor to provide the correct mixture to meet the sudden power demand.</p>

						<p>The pressure to supply this squirt comes from a rubber diaphragm that opens for the air on one side. Normal air pressure which is higher than the partial vacuum inside the carburettor pushes the diaphragm inwards against a piston, which pumps fuel.</p>

						<p>Afterwards, the fast air flow creates a vacuum in the venturi which draws fuel from the main jet. The faster the flow, the more fuel is sucked out. Most carburettors have one or more non-return valves, usually a small ball seating on a conical hole. This prevents wasted flow-back of fuel.</p>

						<h2>Fuel Injection</h2>

						<div class=floating style=float:left;margin-left:2%;>
							<img src=injection.png width=100% height=auto>
							<p>Petrol cars uses indirect injection system. A pump sends the petrol to the engine bay which is then injected into the intake manifold by an injector. There's either a separate injector for each cylinder or one/two injectors on the intake manifold</p>
						</div>

						<p>Traditionally, the <b>AFR (Air-Fuel Ratio)</b> is controlled by the <b>carburettor</b>, which isn't perfect. It's major disadvantage is that a single carburettor supplying a four-cylinder engine cannot give each cylinder precisely the same air-fuel mixture because some of the cylinders are further away from the carburettor than others.</p>

						<p>One solution is to fit multiple carburettors, but they're difficult to tune correctly. Instead, many cars are now installed with fuel-injected engines where the fuel is delivered in precise bursts. Engines with FI (short for Fuel Injection) are usually more efficient and more powerful than carburetted ones, and they can also be more economical, as well as having less poisonous <b>emissions</b>.</p>
					</div>

					<div class=section>
						<h2>Diesel Fuel Injection</h2>
						
						<p>The fuel injection system in petrol engined cars are always indirect, petrol is injected into the intake manifold or intake port rather than directly into the combustion chambers. This ensures that the fuel is well mixed with the air before it enters the chamber.</p>

						<p>Many diesel engines, however, uses direct injection where the diesel is injected directly into the cylinder filled with compressed air. Others use indirect injection in which the diesel fuel is injected into the specially shaped pre-combustion chamber which has a narrow passage connecting it to the cylinder head.</p>

						<p>Only air is drawn into the cylinder. It's heated so much by compression that atomized fuel injected at the end of the compression stroke self-ignites.</p>
					</div>

					<div class=section>
						<h2>Basic Injection</h2>
						
						<p>All modern petrol injection systems uses indirect injection. A special pump sends the fuel under pressure from the fuel tank to the engine bay where, still under pressure, it's distributed individually to each cylinder.</p>

						<p>Depending on the system, the fuel is fired into either the intake manifold or the intake port via an injector. This works like the spray nozzle of a hose, ensuring that the fuel comes out as a fine mist. The fuel mixes with the air passing through the inlet manifold or port and the fuel/air mixture enters the combustion chamber.</p>

						<p>Some cars have multi-point fuel injection where each cylinder is fed by its own injector. This is complex and can be expensive. It's more common to have a single-point injection where a single injector feeds all the cylinders, or to have one injector in every two cylinders.</p>
					</div>

					<div class=section>
						<h2>Injectors</h2>

						<p> The injectors through which the fuel is sprayed are screwed, nozzle-first, into either the intake manifold or the cylinder head and are angled so that the spray of fuel is fired towards the intake valve .

						<p>There's two types of injectors depending on the injection system. The first system uses continuous injection where the fuel is always squirted into the intake port while the engine is running. The injector simply acts as a spray nozzle to break up the fuel into a fine spray - it doesn't actually control the fuel flow. The amount of fuel sprayed is increased or decreased by a mechanical or electrical control unit - in other words, it's just like turning a tap on and off.</p>

						<p>other popular system is timed injection (pulsed injection) where the fuel is delivered in bursts to coincide with the induction stroke of the cylinder. As with continuous injection, timed injection can also be controlled either mechanically or electronically.</p>

						<p>The earliest systems were mechanically controlled. They are often called petrol injection (PI for short) and the fuel flow is controlled by a mechanical regulator assembly. These systems suffer from the drawbacks of being mechanically complex and having poor response to backing off the throttle.</p>

						<p>Mechanical systems have now been largely superseded by electronic fuel injection (known as EFI for short). This is thanks to the increasing reliability and decreasing costs of electronic control systems.</p>
					</div>

					<div class=section>
						<h2>Types of fuel injectors</h2>

						<p>Two main types of injector can be fitted, depending on whether the injection system is mechanically or electronically controlled.

						<div class=container>
							<div class=floating>
								<img src=mechanical.png width=100% height=auto>
								<p>A mechanical fuel injector.</p>
							</div>

							<div class=floating>
								<img src=electronic.png width=100% height=auto>
								<p>An electronic fuel injector.</p>
							</div>
						</div>

						<p>In a mechanical system, the injector is spring-loaded into the closed position and is opened by fuel pressure. The injector in an electronic system is also held closed by a spring, but is opened by an electromagnet built into the injector body. The electronic control unit determines how long the injector stays open.</p>
					</div>

					<div class=section>
						<h2>Mechanical Fuel Injection</h2>
						
						<div class=floating>
							<img src=lucas.png width=100% height=auto>
							<p>In the Lucas system, fuel from the tank is pumped at high pressure to a fuel accumulator. From there it passes into the fuel distributor, which sends a burst of fuel to each injector, from where it is fired into the inlet port. The airflow is controlled by a flap valve which opens in response to the accelerator pedal.</p>
						</div>

						<p>Mechanical fuel injection was used in the 1960s and 1970s by many manufacturers on their higher-performance sports cars and sports saloons. One type fitted to many British cars, including the Triumph TR6 PI and 2500 PI, was the Lucas PI system, which is a timed system.

						<p>A high-pressure electric fuel pump mounted near the fuel tank pumps fuel at a pressure of 100psi up to a fuel accumulator. This is basically a short-term reservoir that keeps the fuel-supply pressure constant and also stabilises the pulses of fuel coming from the pump.</p>

						<p>From the accumulator, the fuel passes through a paper element filter and then feeds into the fuel-metering control unit, also known as the fuel distributor. This unit is driven from the camshaft and its job, as the name suggests, is to distribute the fuel to each cylinder, at the correct time and in the correct amounts.</p>

						<p>The amount of fuel injected is controlled by a flap valve located in the engine's air intake. The flap sits beneath the control unit and rises and falls in response to airflow - as you open the throttle, the 'suck' from the cylinders increases the airflow and the flap rises. This alters the position of a shuttle valve within the metering control unit to allow more fuel to be squirted into the cylinders.</p>

						<p>From the metering unit, the fuel is delivered to each of the injectors in turn. The fuel then squirts out into the inlet port in the cylinder head. Each injector contains a spring-loaded valve that is kept closed by its spring pressure. The valve only opens when the fuel is squirted in.</p>

						<p>For cold starting, you can't just block off part of the airflow to enrich the fuel/air mixture as you can with a carburettor. Instead a manual control on the dash (resembling a choke knob) or, on later models, a microprocessor alters the position of the shuttle valve within the metering unit. This activates an extra injector mounted in the manifold, causing it to squirt in extra fuel to enrich the mixture.</p>
