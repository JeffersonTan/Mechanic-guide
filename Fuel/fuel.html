						<h1>Carburettors</h1>
						
						<div class=floating style=width:300px;>
							<img src=solex.gif width=100% height=auto>
							<p>A typical fixed-jet carburettor. This is a Solex type carburettor where the air flows from the top to bottom. This is called a down-draught carburettor.</p>
						</div>

						<p>A carburettor mixes fuel and air to a certain ratio that the engine needs at any time. It does this by spraying fuel into the moving air stream through a jet, which vaporizes the fuel making an explosive mixture. The faster an engine runs, the more air it sucks in. The air passes through a narrow neck inside the carburettor (Called <b>venturi</b>), which speeds up its flow.</p>

						<p>As air flows faster, it's pressure drops which creates a small vacuum in the venturi. The fuel jet opens in the venturi, and the partial vacuum sucks fuel through the jet into the air stream. The speed of an engine is controlled by a throttle, a moveable circular flap linked to the gas pedal which partly blocks the venturi to control variable amounts of air.</p>

						<p>The simplest way to control the amount of fuel that flows through the jet so that the air-fuel ratio is correct is with a variable jet.

						<h2>Variable Jet Carburettors</h2>

						<p>The fuel jet is partially blocked by a tapered needle, which can be raised progressively to unblock it. The needle is fixed to a piston, which is able to freely slide up and down in a chamber above the jet. The top of the chamber is linked to the intake manifold through a narrow passage.</p>
						
						<div class=container>
							<div class=floating>
								<img src=variable.png width=100% height=auto>
								<p>Low vacuum in the piston chamber.</p>
							</div>
							<div class=floating>
								<img src=variable2.png width=100% height=auto>
								<p>At full throttle, the butterfly valve is fully open.</p>
							</div>
							<div class=floating>
								<img src=variable3.png width=100% height=auto>
								<p>Operating the choke lowers the jet, which allows more fuel to be drawn in.</p>
							</div>
						</div>

						<p>When the engine idles, low manifold depression and light spring causes the piston to sit at the bottom of the chamber, and the needle almost completely blocks the jet. Only a small amount of fuel flows. As the throttle opens, more air flows into the engine. The engine speeds up and sucks more air in.</p>

						<p>This suction creates a partial vacuum in the intake manifold and in the top of the chamber. The vacuum is more powerful than the small vacuum in the venturi under the piston, so it pulls the piston up which unblocks the jet and lets more fuel flow. The sudden burst of acceleration will cause a sudden rush of mixture into the intake manifold, which weakens the vacuum.</p>

						<p>That allows the piston to fall, closing the jet and weakening the mixture. But, that can be solved by using an oil-filled damper attached to the piston, which prevents it from moving too quickly. Therefore, the mixture doesn't suddenly become too weak for a smooth combustion.</p>

						<h3>The float chamber</h3>

						<p>For a carburettor to maintain a steady fuel flow, it needs to draw from a fuel supply which is always kept at the same level. That supply is provided by a float chamber attached to the carburettor. The float chamber has a pivoted float which bears against a needle valve through which fuel enters the chamber.</p>

						<h2>Fixed Jet Carburettors</h2>

						<p>The fixed jet Carburettors resembles the simpler <b>variable-jet</b> type in having a venturi. The partial vacuum caused by increased air speed through the venturi sucks fuel through a jet to mix with the air. Similarly, air flow is controlled by a throttle flap linked to the accelerator pedal to regulate engine speed. A choke flap above the throttle partially blocks the air flow to give a richer mixture for starting. Like in all carburettors, a float chamber provides a steady supply of fuel.</p>

						<h3>Changing from jet to jet</h3>

									flex-flow:column;

								.container .floating {
									margin:3%;
									width: 95%;
								}
							}
						</style>

						<div class=container>
							<div class=floating>
								<img src=idle.png width=100% height=auto>
								<p>The engine idling with the throttle closed. A small amount of mixture passes through the caps on each side of the throttle flap, or butterfly.</p>
							</div>
							<div class=floating>
								<img src=sudden.png width=100% height=auto>
								<p>During sudden acceleration the accelerator pump comes into action and provides a richer mixture.</p>
							</div>
							<div class=floating>
								<img src=full.png width=100% height=auto>
								<p>The engine running fast at wide throttle. The butterfly is almost vertical, allowing free passage of the mixture.</p>
							</div>
						</div>

						<p>The fixed-jet carburettor has open <b>jets</b> to regulate fuel flow through them. Consequently there must be several jets of different sizes to provide the different amounts of fuel needed at any moment. When the engine is idling, very little fuel is required. There's not a lot of air flowing through the almost closed <b>throttle</b> - too little to draw any fuel through the main jet in the <b>venturi</b>.</p>

						<p>But there's a high <b>vacuum</b> underneath the throttle flap, where there's a tiny slow-running jet that forms part of the often complex slow-running (idling) circuit. The vacuum pulls a trickle of fuel through this jet to keep the engine idling.</p>

						<p>When the throttle is opened, the air flow suddenly speeds up. An <b>accelerator</b> pump linked to the throttle provides a brief squirt of extra fuel to enrich the mixture temporarily to prevent a flat spot - a momentary hesitation - which is the inability of the carburettor to provide the correct mixture to meet the sudden power demand.</p>

						<p>The pressure to supply this squirt comes from a rubber diaphragm that opens for the air on one side. Normal air pressure which is higher than the partial vacuum inside the carburettor pushes the diaphragm inwards against a piston, which pumps fuel.</p>

						<p>Afterwards, the fast air flow creates a vacuum in the venturi which draws fuel from the main jet. The faster the flow, the more fuel is sucked out. Most carburettors have one or more non-return valves, usually a small ball seating on a conical hole. This prevents wasted flow-back of fuel.</p>
